Do you know where to go if you have questions or comments about Thor or projects available from Thor?

> For many years we posted issues or comments on the Thor or GoFish Google Groups forums.  However, be aware those forums have been deprecated. The preferred location going forward is the Issue tabs in the GitHub repository for the project your issue relates to.

Thor provides two different ways to get to the GitHub repository for a project, both available from the Thor menu:

1. Item "VFPX Home Page" takes you (surprisingly!) to the VFPX home page ( http://vfpx.org ).  The Projects page there is the most used page: it lists the projects alphabetically (as a link to the home page for it) and has separate columns for a brief description, category, and status.  This list includes many VFPX projects that are not available from Thor's Check For Updates as well as some other VFP open-source projects that arenâ€™t considered to be part of VFPX.

2. Item "Project Home Pages" opens up a mini-form of all projects that Thor can download along with their status; the project name is a link to the home page.

To add or review issues for a project, click on "Issues" at the upper left of the home page:

You're encouraged to watch all activity for projects you're interested in. Click on "Watch" (or it might say "Unwatch") at the upper right of the home page. You'll see some extra chatter, but it may be that you'll learn more about some projects from the comments of others.
